# Agent Graph: notes for agents

A bb plugin that draws a live node graph of bb agents: project → thread →
turn → tool call / subagent / workflow agent, plus child threads. See
README.md for features and the code map.

## Status (as of 2026-09-23)

- v0.1.0 is released: tag `v0.1.0` on
  https://github.com/nathancolgate/bb-plugin-agent-graph (public, MIT).
- Marketplace listing is live (merged 2026-09-23):
  https://github.com/get-bb/marketplace/pull/342. The listing tracks
  `^0.1.0`, so new `v0.1.x` tags reach users without another marketplace PR.
  A new PR is needed only to change the source, name, icon, description,
  category, screenshots or version range. The listing files live in that
  repo: `entries/agent-graph.json`, `overview/agent-graph.md`,
  `screenshots/agent-graph/`.
- The user's own bb runs this plugin from this folder
  (`bb plugin source agent-graph` shows `path:/home/nathan/rails/bb-plugin-agent-graph`).
- History: the plugin was built in bb thread `thr_wn7da87tmr` (Personal
  project). @-mention it to read the full conversation.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
bb plugin dev        # rebuild and reload on save
npm test             # node --test: tests/layout.test.ts, tests/timeline.test.ts
npm run typecheck
bb plugin build
bb agent-graph --thread <id>   # quick check of the graph data from a shell
```

Visual checks: the page is at `http://127.0.0.1:38886/plugins/agent-graph/graph`.
The `agent-browser` CLI can open and screenshot it. Only one agent should
drive that browser at a time, because it is a shared session.

## Release

1. Bump `version` in package.json (patch for fixes, minor for features;
   a minor bump means updating the marketplace range, e.g. `^0.2.0`).
2. Run the checks above, then commit.
3. Ask the user before pushing. Then:
   `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z" && git push origin main vX.Y.Z`

## Things worth knowing

- **Timelines:** finished turns come as a `turn` row. The user prompt comes
  before it with no turnId, and the reply after it with the turnId. The live
  turn comes as flat rows sharing a turnId. `timeline.ts` normalizes both
  and is unit tested.
- **Cache:** a thread's `updatedAt` does NOT change while a turn streams.
  The timeline cache in `server.ts` is evicted on every structural
  `thread:changed` event, and running threads always refetch.
- **Background subagents:** a background delegation row is "completed" at
  launch. The subagent counts as running until its `SubagentHandback` child
  appears (Claude Code specific). Its real output is the handback's
  `toolArgs.message`.
- **Settings:** bb settings only support string/boolean/select/project, not
  numbers, so the numeric settings are selects parsed in `parseConfig`.
- The frontend must not import runtime values from `server.ts` (that would
  bundle server code). Shared values go in `shared.ts`.

## Open ideas (from the review, not done yet)

- Arrow-key navigation of the tree (roving tabindex, `role="tree"`).
- A simplified card style below ~70% zoom (bigger label, no sublabel).
- Only render on-screen nodes, and memoize cards, for 1000+ node graphs.
  Also move the pulse animation off `box-shadow`.
- Highlight the selected node's path to the root and dim the rest.
- Map `backgroundTask` timeline rows explicitly (they fall back to generic
  tool nodes).
- A color palette checked for color-blind users (shell green vs. done green,
  web blue vs. running blue).
